GUI for the [Car Cost Calculator](https://github.com/DC23/car-cost-calculator).
An attempt at a total cost of ownership calculator, simply because I plan to get a new car and typically overthink the whole thing.

To use this, you need to clone both repos from Git.
The Pipfile for this project expects to find the car-cost-calculator code in an
adjacent directory.
