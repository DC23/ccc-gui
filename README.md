GUI for the [Car Cost Calculator](https://github.com/DC23/car-cost-calculator).
An attempt at a total cost of ownership calculator, simply because I plan to get a new car and typically overthink the whole thing.

To use this, you need to clone both repos from Git and install into a Python
environment. Neither are in PyPI.
